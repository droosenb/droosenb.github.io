        <h3>An Introduction</h3>
        <p>Recently, I came across the physical archives of the Soft Noises forum, a long story which I may get into later. I had never heard of it before, but inside the archives I found a small forum which operated from around 2005 - 2012. By my best estimation
            only a few hundred people ever posted, but a surprising amount was created, based on the amount of archival data. I've selected a thread here which I found to be mostly complete. </p>

        <p>I was sent here on the reccomendation of mcats and the guys at tuberadioforum.com. He said that you guys tend to deal with the weird problems that they can't figure out.<br> The problem is such: I have an old tube radio in the all american five
            style which makes a weird noise when tuned to 93.7 FM. <br> Initially, the radio was having some problems on all frequencies, so I sent it in to an aquaintence who repairs old audio gear who repaired it. He tested it and sent it back to me
            with a fully clean report. However, when I tested it out at home, I found a weird repetitive clicking happening on that frequency. I sent it back to my freind the tech, but he was unable to replicate the problem. <br> Neither my freind or
            anyone on tuberadioforum.com could figure out the source of the problem. I'm pretty much at a loss at this point, so I was hoping you all might be able to help?

            <p>Dear Blacksocks333, <br> Could you provide some more details about the situation, like the radio's model? Also, have you tried to eliminate any outside sources of electrical interference? <br> Sincerely, <br> Josh Daniels</p>
